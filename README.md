# Stock-Market-Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of a stock market price prediction algorithm using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. The goal of this project is to provide more accurate stock price predictions compared to existing algorithms by leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks.

# Introduction
Predicting stock market prices is a challenging task that traditionally involves significant human-computer interaction. The correlated nature of stock prices makes conventional batch processing methods inefficient for stock market analysis. In this project, we propose an online learning algorithm that utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, to adjust weights for individual data points using stochastic gradient descent.

# Usage
To use the stock market prediction algorithm, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the installation guide.
Prepare your stock market data in the appropriate format. Ensure that the data includes the key performance indicators (KPIs) such as opening price, closing price, low price, high price, and trading volume.
Train the LSTM network using the provided training script and your dataset.
Evaluate the accuracy of the trained model using the evaluation script.
Compare the results with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for accuracy assessment.
Results and Analysis
The algorithm was trained and evaluated using datasets of various sizes. The accuracy of the LSTM model was compared to an ANN model. The results indicate that the LSTM model outperformed the ANN model in terms of prediction accuracy.

The analysis also revealed that both models achieved better accuracy as the size of the dataset increased. With more data, the models were able to capture additional patterns and adjust the weights of the layers more effectively.

# Future Extensions
While this stock prediction system focuses on numerical analysis, an interesting future extension would be to incorporate sentiment analysis from social media platforms such as Twitter. By analyzing the emotions expressed in related articles and tweets, the LSTM model could potentially improve its accuracy by considering contextual information and human sentiments.
